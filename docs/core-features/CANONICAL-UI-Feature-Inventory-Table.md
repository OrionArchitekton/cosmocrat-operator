# UI Feature Inventory Table

| Feature | Location / Component | Quarantine Mechanism |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Projects & Tasks Kanban UI (project board, task list) | frontend/src/pages/ProjectTasks.tsx (uses TaskKanbanBoard component) | Route flagged as “LEGACY VIBE KANBAN (quarantined)” in App routes[\[1\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/App.tsx#L175-L183) |
| Task Attempt Details & Follow-Up Panel (logs, diffs, follow-ups) | TaskAttemptPanel (with TaskFollowUpSection) in task panel UI | Included in quarantined task routes; follow-up input is present but chat follow-ups are disabled via config (followUpMessagesEnabled: false)[\[2\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L61-L65) |

| Chat Command Bar & Create Chat Box (NL command input) | frontend/src/components/ui-new/dialogs/CommandBarDialog.tsx; CreateChatBoxContainer in new UI | Hidden behind “create mode” in new UI; globally off via chat.commandBarEnabled: false (no chat bar)[\[2\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L61-L65) |

# Enablement Classification Table

| Feature | Status | Justification |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Projects & Tasks Kanban UI (Board and Task list) | **SAFE\_TO\_ENABLE\_NOW** | Read-only project organization; improves clarity of work in progress. Does not execute code – tasks reflect Chronicle data and require manual start[\[6\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L26-L34)[\[4\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L67-L70). |
| Task Attempt Detail View & Logs/Diffs | **SAFE\_TO\_ENABLE\_NOW** | Review-only panels (logs, diff viewer) already pull from Chronicle “truth”[\[7\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/operator-plane/OperatorPlanePanel.tsx#L170-L178). Follow-up UI is present but sending messages remains user-driven and gated (no autonomous action). |
| Agent Profiles Management (Executors config) | **ENABLE\_AFTER\_DOGFOOD\_ONLY** | Configuration UI for coding agents. Harbors no direct execution, but needs internal testing to ensure disabled agents stay unavailable and user cannot select unsupported executors[\[8\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L41-L49)[\[9\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L43-L50). |
| MCP Server/Client Integration | **ENABLE\_AFTER\_DOGFOOD\_ONLY** | Allows external tools to manipulate tasks (via local MCP). Needs internal vetting – it’s powerful but local-only[\[10\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/docs/integrations/vibe-kanban-mcp-server.mdx#L12-L20). Gating still applies to any attempts, but external control of task creation merits caution. |
| Chat Command Bar & “Create” Chat Box | **ENABLE\_AFTER\_DOGFOOD\_ONLY** | Natural-language command UI. User-initiated, but conversation workflows are complex. Requires confirmation that every code action still funnels through Chronicle gating (no streaming auto-commit). |
| AI Follow-Up Messages (multi-turn on tasks) | **ENABLE\_AFTER\_DOGFOOD\_ONLY** | User can prompt AI to refine code. Likely safe (user-in-loop) but multi-turn agent sessions must be verified to respect gates on each iteration (prevent the AI from bypassing approval). |
| Automated Task Generation (AI planning tasks) | **PERMANENTLY\_DISABLED** | Violates “does not create work” invariant – would let AI spawn tasks autonomously[\[4\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L67-L70). Too much autonomy (task scheduling without explicit human request). |
| Background Autonomous Agents | **PERMANENTLY\_DISABLED** | Directly conflicts with no-background invariant[\[4\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L67-L70). Unattended execution or continuous agent loops are out of bounds for safety (no human gate in the loop). |

# Risk & Guardrail Notes

**Projects & Tasks Kanban UI – Risks & Protections:** Enabling the project/task board is low-risk. It **does not auto-run anything**, it simply displays tasks in columns (To-do, In Progress, etc.). A potential concern is if an operator drags a task into an “In Progress” column expecting it to run – but in our UI, drag-and-drop only changes status and triggers no execution (the config keeps direct executors off by default[\[8\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L41-L49)). **Invariant protection:** All task data is fetched from Chronicle or server APIs, meaning the board is just a view of the authoritative state (no local divergence). The UI already labels the diff source as “From Chronicle”[\[11\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/operator-plane/OperatorPlanePanel.tsx#L152-L159), reinforcing that it’s read-only. **Required guardrails:** Clearly label the board as a planning/review tool (e.g. “No task runs without manual start”) to set expectations. We may also enforce a rule of one running attempt at a time (e.g. disable “Start” on other tasks if one attempt is active) to honor the “no background agents” rule.

**Task Attempt Detail & Follow-Up – Risks & Protections:** Allowing the task detail view (logs and diffs for attempts) is purely informational – it shows what the agent did and any code changes. There is **no added execution power** here; the diff viewer is read-only[\[12\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/operator-plane/OperatorPlanePanel.tsx#L150-L158) and logs are static. The **follow-up message panel**, if enabled, lets the human operator send an additional instruction to the agent for the same task. The risk is that a follow-up might let the agent continue working on code beyond the initial intent. However, **human-in-the-loop gates still apply**: any new code generated from a follow-up still appears as draft diffs requiring approval (the Chronicle events feed and G3/G4 gates remain in effect). The system never auto-commits code without a Passed gate. **Invariant protection:** Chronicle remains the source of truth for each incremental change, and gate G3 (review) must be passed on every new diff. **Guardrails:** The UI should highlight that follow-ups are “Additional instructions – code changes still require approval.” Perhaps a read-only badge or a tooltip on the follow-up input can remind the user that the AI’s next actions won’t apply unless they approve them. This ensures transparency that follow-ups don’t bypass any gate.

**Agent Profiles Management – Risks & Protections:** Enabling the Agents settings page lets the operator view and edit the configuration of coding agents (executor profiles). This does **not itself execute anything** – it’s a form input for JSON/YAML config and profile selection. The primary risk is an operator selecting an unsupported or quarantined agent model (e.g. one of the disabled ones like claude\_code or copilot) which could lead to errors or an attempt to run an unvetted executor. **Invariant protection:** The system’s disabled agent list[\[8\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L41-L49)[\[9\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L43-L50) prevents any disallowed model from actually launching – those calls would be rejected by the backend if attempted. To be safe, the UI should not even present disabled agents as options. **Guardrails:** Clearly mark any experimental profiles, and grey-out or hide executors that remain in quarantine (perhaps showing them as “coming soon” rather than selectable). Additionally, adding a note in the UI (or an alert on save) like “Changing profiles does not override human approval steps” can reassure that even if the user switches to a more advanced model, it cannot bypass Chronicle or gates. The config save action goes through the Chronicle-backed settings (persisted via config files), so there’s no autonomy risk – just ensure good UX messaging around it.

**MCP Integration (External Tool Hooks) – Risks & Protections:** The MCP server/client feature would allow external programs (like Raycast or other agent clients) to connect to the Cosmocrat Operator and manipulate tasks via an API[\[13\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/docs/integrations/vibe-kanban-mcp-server.mdx#L6-L14). The upside is improved operator efficiency (e.g. populating tasks from outside or triggering operations via scripts), but the risk is effectively opening a controlled “API” for task control. This does not increase the AI’s intrinsic autonomy (the MCP server is local-only and cannot be accessed remotely[\[10\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/docs/integrations/vibe-kanban-mcp-server.mdx#L12-L20)), but it could allow a user’s local script – or an AI agent that the user intentionally connects – to rapidly create or start tasks. **Invariant protection:** Chronicle and gates still stand between these actions and real execution. For example, an external call to start\_task\_attempt would still initiate an attempt that goes through G1–G6 as normal (it’s just as if the user clicked “Start” on a task, but automated). There is no bypass of Chronicle – the MCP calls use the same internal API as the UI does for task creation and attempts. To be cautious, **guardrails** needed include an **explicit user opt-in**: perhaps a toggle “Enable external MCP integrations (local only)” in settings, off by default. When on, a conspicuous label or modal can warn: “**Warning:** External clients can now create and start tasks in Cosmocrat. All actions still require human approval to complete.” This ensures the operator knows they’ve effectively opened a control interface. Additionally, any task or attempt created via MCP should be visibly tagged in the UI (e.g. an icon or note “via API”) so the operator isn’t surprised by tasks appearing. The local-only nature and continued gate checks mitigate autonomy concerns, but transparency is key.

**Chat Command Bar / Create Chat Mode – Risks & Protections:** The chat-oriented UI (command bar and create-chat box) lets the operator interact with the system in natural language. For example, the “create” chat box allows an operator to *“Describe the task…”* and then presumably generates a task or attempt from that description[\[14\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/ui-new/primitives/CreateChatBox.tsx#L92-L101)[\[15\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/ui-new/primitives/CreateChatBox.tsx#L150-L159). The risk here is **workflow confusion and potential bypass of structured checks**: a chat interface might encourage rapid, conversational commands that initiate code generation without the operator explicitly filling out forms or clicking “start.” If not tightly integrated, the AI could proceed to write code in a conversational loop. However, to remain enterprise-safe, **any code generation triggered by chat must still flow through the same Chronicle events and gating**. In other words, even if an operator says “Implement feature X” in the command bar, the resulting attempt should still create a draft diff and pause at gate G3 for review – exactly as if they used the standard form. **Invariant protection:** as long as the underlying execution kernel does not allow the AI to commit or run tests without gate approvals, the chat interface is just a friendlier input method, not a new autonomous path. **Guardrails:** We must make the chat mode clearly **non-autonomous**. For example, the UI can display a banner in chat sessions: “All actions are supervised – the assistant cannot make changes until you approve them.” Also, disabling any streaming of code execution in real-time ensures the operator explicitly steps through gates. The command palette (if enabled) should similarly restrict any one-click actions that would normally require a gate. For instance, if the command bar has an action “Commit all changes,” we must ensure that actually just triggers the normal commit proposal (which would be logged and still require the Chronicle to mark G3-\>G4). A safe approach is to limit the command bar to **review-enhancing commands** (navigation, summaries, etc.) initially, and only allow potentially dangerous actions once we confirm they obey gate logic. In summary, the chat UI can be enabled after careful internal testing, with prominent UI warnings and possibly a “read-only mode” indicator until the user explicitly approves an action.

# Enablement Order (Top 5\)

1. **Enable Projects & Tasks Kanban UI** – *Flag:* Switch QUARANTINE\_CONFIG.mode from 'operator-plane-v1' to a mode that includes the Kanban, or specifically enable the /projects and /tasks routes. In practice, this means allowing the React routes under “LEGACY VIBE KANBAN” to be accessible (removing or modifying the quarantine condition). *UI Copy:* Add a header or help text on the Projects page: e.g. “**Project Board –** Organize tasks and track attempts. (No code runs until you start an attempt.)”. *Acceptance Test:* Verify that an operator can navigate to **Projects** and see a list of projects (or a default project). Within a project, the Kanban board should display tasks grouped by status (Todo, In Progress, etc.). The operator should be able to create a new task via the “+” button on a column[\[16\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskKanbanBoard.tsx#L56-L64)[\[17\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/tasks/TaskKanbanBoard.tsx#L70-L78), edit task titles, and drag tasks between columns *without any agent starting on its own*. Confirm that nothing happens execution-wise until the user explicitly initiates an attempt.

2. **Enable Task Attempt Viewing (Logs & Diffs in UI)** – *Flag:* No new flag needed beyond enabling the tasks routes; ensure followUpMessagesEnabled remains false for now if we’re staggering features. This will allow the TaskAttemptPanel (with logs and diff viewer) to render when an attempt is selected. *UI Copy:* On the Task Attempt view, add a subtle note or badge: “Viewing attempt outputs – all changes are provisional until approved in Chronicle.” This leverages the existing “From Chronicle” label on the Diff panel[\[11\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/operator-plane/OperatorPlanePanel.tsx#L152-L159) to reinforce the source of truth. *Acceptance Test:* From the Kanban board, have the operator click on a task that has an attempt (or start a new attempt manually, see step 3). The right-hand panel should show **Attempt Logs** (the streaming log of agent actions) and a **Diff Preview** of code changes. Confirm that the diff header shows “From Chronicle”[\[11\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/operator-plane/OperatorPlanePanel.tsx#L152-L159). The operator should see gate statuses (if the attempt is ongoing) and be unable to merge or commit code except via the existing approval buttons (which remain in the Operator Plane panel or Attempt view). Essentially, verify the UI is showing the read-only diff and log content for review, matching what’s in Chronicle.

3. **Allow Starting an Attempt from a Task (Single at a time)** – *Flag:* Set executors.enabled: true in the quarantine config[\[8\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L41-L49) to re-enable direct task execution controls. This will activate the “Start attempt” flow on the task Actions menu (the “Create New Attempt” dialog)[\[18\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/ui/actions-dropdown.tsx#L202-L210). *UI Copy:* When the user initiates an attempt, we can show a confirmation modal or toast: “Attempt started. Monitor progress – approvals still required at each gate.” This is essentially what the system does, but a reminder pop-up improves clarity that nothing will auto-complete without them. *Acceptance Test:* On the Kanban board, with a task selected, use the Actions dropdown (••• menu) and click “Start New Attempt”[\[18\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/ui/actions-dropdown.tsx#L202-L210). The Create Attempt dialog should appear, allowing selection of an executor profile and branch[\[19\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/dialogs/tasks/CreateAttemptDialog.tsx#L182-L190)[\[20\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/dialogs/tasks/CreateAttemptDialog.tsx#L194-L201). After confirming, the task should move to “In Progress” and a new attempt entry appears (and possibly navigates to the attempt detail view). Critically, verify that the attempt follows the governed loop: check that after G1, the AI’s work is visible and paused awaiting approval at G3 (e.g., the diff is present but not merged). Also confirm that if an attempt is running, the UI either prevents starting another attempt on a different task or clearly indicates that doing so will pause/stop the current one (depending on system capabilities). Ideally, attempt to start a second concurrent attempt – the expected behavior (by design policy) is that it should be disallowed or queued. If it’s allowed, we need to document that as a known limitation and instruct one-at-a-time usage.

4. **Enable Follow-Up Message Panel (Conditional on test)** – *Flag:* Set chat.followUpMessagesEnabled: true in config[\[2\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L61-L65) once internal testing confirms multi-turn does not bypass any Chronicle logging. *UI Copy:* Inside the follow-up input area, include helper text like: “Ask the AI to refine or continue – all changes will appear as new diffs for review.” Possibly label the send button as “Submit Follow-Up (Review Required)” to be explicit. *Acceptance Test:* During an active task attempt (after the AI has produced an initial diff and is waiting at a gate), have the operator type a follow-up instruction (e.g. “Also update the unit tests for this function”) and send it. The system should record this as a follow-up event (e.g., Chronicle logs a new user\_message event) and the AI should produce additional code changes. Verify that these new changes appear in the Diff viewer and that the attempt still requires approval to merge them (i.e., it remains in a pending state, likely resetting to gate G3 again for the new diff). Confirm that a follow-up does not auto-merge anything and that the UI shows the updated Chronicle events count increased[\[21\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/operator-plane/OperatorPlanePanel.tsx#L124-L133). Essentially, the follow-up should seamlessly continue the loop under governance.

5. **(Optional in Wave 1\) Reinstate Agent Profiles UI** – *Flag:* Set automation.agentProfilesEnabled: true[\[4\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L67-L70) to allow the **Agents** settings page to be functional. *UI Copy:* On the Agent Settings page, add a banner or info box: “Configure coding agent settings. *Note:* Some agents may be unavailable in this mode.” This prepares users for the fact that certain profiles are still disabled. Additionally, next to each agent name or in a tooltip, indicate if it’s experimental or enterprise-approved. *Acceptance Test:* In **Settings → Agents**, the operator should see the list of executor profiles (e.g., “Claude Code”, “Codex”, etc.) and the JSON editor for agent configurations. Try creating a new profile or modifying one. Saving should succeed and reflect in the user config (no errors). Also test selecting a different base agent (if any are enabled) and ensure that starting an attempt uses the chosen profile. If the operator selects a profile corresponding to a previously disabled agent (one from the quarantine list[\[9\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L43-L50)), the UI should prevent execution – e.g., trying to start an attempt with that profile should result in a clear error or no-op with a message like “Agent not available”. This confirms that the backend quarantine still blocks disallowed executors, as expected. The page itself loading and saving config demonstrates the feature is on, without increasing any autonomy.

*(The first three features above are the high-priority “wave 1” improvements – focusing on task visibility and controlled execution. The latter two (follow-ups and profiles) can be toggled on selectively once verified internally.)*

# Permanent Disable List

* **Autonomous Task Generation by AI (“Turn plan into tasks”):** **Do Not Enable.** This feature would let the AI create new tasks without human oversight – violating the “does not create or schedule work on its own” rule. In the current design, all task creation must be operator-driven. Auto-generation was explicitly turned off[\[4\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L67-L70) and should remain off, as it represents the AI planning and queuing up work (a form of autonomy that Enterprise hardening disallows).

* **Background/Unattended Agents:** **Do Not Enable.** Any mode where an agent continues running in the background (or runs multiple tasks sequentially without intervention) must stay disabled. This includes features like continuous loop mode or auto-approve that were never exposed. Enabling background agents (backgroundAgentsEnabled in config[\[4\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/config/quarantine.ts#L67-L70)) would directly break the invariant that “the Operator Plane can never execute more powerfully because of a UI toggle” – it would grant the AI prolonged, unsupervised execution time, which is off-limits.

* **Streaming Chat-First Execution:** **Do Not Enable (in current form).** The idea of a fully chat-driven autonomous session (where the AI streams actions continuously from a prompt) is counter to the gated approach. Until we can guarantee every action in a chat session is gated, we cannot allow free-form streaming agent conversations. The command bar and chat UI should remain gated or off; we will not permit a mode where an operator says “build this feature” and the AI just goes off writing code and merging it in one go. Any chat feature must retain the stepwise approval workflow, otherwise it stays off.

*(In summary, any capability that effectively bypasses the Chronicle or the gates – creating work, running on its own, or executing changes without explicit human approval – is permanently out of scope. These features remain quarantined indefinitely to uphold our non-negotiable safety invariants.)*

# Final Recommendation

We recommend a **cautious reactivation** of select Vibe Kanban UI elements that enhance operator insight **without granting any new autonomy** to the system. The first wave focuses on visual and organizational tools – the Projects Kanban board, task detail views, and one-at-a-time attempt controls – which **keep the human firmly in control**. These features are **strictly read-oriented or require explicit user initiation**, and all data originates from Chronicle (ensuring the UI cannot fabricate or execute anything unlogged[\[7\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/operator-plane/OperatorPlanePanel.tsx#L170-L178)[\[11\]](https://github.com/OrionArchitekton/cosmocrat-operator/blob/369e1fc3acbeeef458a2cd97221e7aad81b000dd/frontend/src/components/operator-plane/OperatorPlanePanel.tsx#L152-L159)). By gradually enabling these components (and clearly labeling their function and limitations in the UI), we improve transparency and usability for operators.

Crucially, none of the recommended features alter the governed loop: the Operator Plane will not execute more powerfully or autonomously due to a UI change. Every code generation still waits on human gates G3/G4, every task is still created or started by a deliberate user action, and no background processes will spawn. We will **not** restore any feature that end-runs our safety model – no automatic task creation, no self-governing agents, and no chat-driven commits. Those remain off-limits.

This plan upholds the statement: *“The Operator Plane can never execute more powerfully because of a UI toggle.”* Each enabled UI element has been vetted against the invariants (✅ no automatic execution, ✅ no Chronicle bypass, ✅ no gate changes). In practice, this means the Cosmocrat Operator will feel more informative and user-friendly to the operator, **but it will behave with the same constrained, human-in-the-loop execution policy as before**. All enhancements are in service of operator clarity – giving users better visibility and control – with zero increase in the system’s autonomous capabilities or authority. The result is a more transparent cockpit that still flies strictly under human command and Chronicle’s watchful eye.
